                No! Super Leo Lig uses the Puzzle SDK and wallet, which are optimized for multiparty privacy games. Because Super Leo lig implements the Puzzle SDK, all wagered amounts are stored in a time-locked multisig. If an opponent decides to not finish the game, the wagered amount is released to the user after the time-lock expires.
